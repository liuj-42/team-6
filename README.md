Term Project: Mental Health for Students Website

This website is a place for college students that are struggling with their day-to-day life in college and deal with stress and anxiety. To best serve this key audience, our site has been made as easy as possible to navigate so that students can get the help that they need. The site offers many resources, such as statistics about mental health, daily quotes to help brighten students' days, a sample schedule that can help with schedule planning, various products for relaxation, and lists of healthy foods and drinks, along with the benefits they offer. Our site also features a form/survey that users can enter information into, such as how they are feeling and what products they like to use to relieve stress. Below the form, a product recommendation is displayed. We also have a page that contains links to other helpful resources, should students need them.
